CareOps  challenges you to build a single, unified operations platform prototype that replaces the chaos of disconnected tools used by service-based businesses.
🚀 Project Overview
Build a Unified Operations Platform (End-to-End Prototype)
Most service businesses today run on tool chaos.
One tool for leads.
Another for bookings.
Another for email or SMS.
Another for forms.
Another for inventory.
Another for reports.
None of these tools talk to each other.
The result?

Leads are missed
Follow-ups are delayed
Bookings fall through
Forms remain incomplete
Inventory runs out unexpectedly
Owners have no real-time visibility
Your task is to build one single platform that connects all of this into one clear operational system.
🧩 1. Context & Problem (Simple Explanation)
Service businesses struggle because:

Information is scattered
Teams work blindly
Owners only find problems after damage is done
This hackathon asks you to solve that by building:

One system where the business can see, act, and operate clearly from a single dashboard.
🛠️ 2. What You Are Building (In Simple Terms)
You are building a web-based operations platform that allows a business to:

Set up their workspace once
Receive customer inquiries
Accept bookings for services or meetings
Communicate via email and SMS
Automatically send forms after booking
Track booking and customer status
Track basic inventory or resources
Receive alerts when attention is required
Allow staff to manage daily work
Allow owners to monitor everything from one dashboard
🚫 Customers do NOT log in.
All interactions happen via links, forms, and messages.
👥 3. Users & Roles
The system has only two internal roles.
3.1 Business Owner (Admin)
The owner:

Sets up the business
Configures the system
Monitors performance
Intervenes only when required
This role focuses on visibility and control, not daily execution.
3.2 Staff User
Staff members:

Handle customer communication
Manage bookings
Track form completion
Update booking status
They cannot:

Change system configuration
Modify automation rules
Manage integrations
🧭 4. Business Onboarding Flow (MOST IMPORTANT)
This is the foundation of the entire product.

After onboarding, the business must be fully operational without manual intervention.
Step 1: Create Workspace
The business owner:

Creates an account
Creates a workspace
Enters:Business name
Address (important for in-person services)
Time zone
Contact email
⚠️ Nothing is active yet.
Step 2: Set Up Email & SMS
The business owner connects:

Email service (confirmations, alerts)
SMS service (reminders, short updates)
Rules:

At least one channel is mandatory
All communication flows through integrations
Failures must be logged and visible
After this step:

The Inbox becomes active
Step 3: Create Contact Form
The owner creates a public form with:

Name
Email or phone
Optional message
When submitted:

A Contact is created
A Conversation is started
A welcome message is sent automatically
Step 4: Set Up Bookings
The owner defines:

Service / meeting types
Duration
Availability (days & time slots)
Location (for in-person meetings)
This generates a public booking page.
Step 5: Set Up Forms (Post-Booking)
The owner uploads required forms:

Intake form
Agreement
Supporting documents
Forms are linked to booking types.
When a booking occurs:

Forms are sent automatically
Completion status is tracked
Step 6: Set Up Inventory / Resources
The owner defines:

Items or resources used per booking
Quantity available
Low-stock threshold
This enables:

Usage forecasting
Automated alerts
Step 7: Add Staff & Permissions
The owner:

Invites staff users
Assigns permissions for:Inbox
Bookings
Forms
Inventory visibility
Step 8: Activate Workspace
Before activation, the system verifies:

Communication channel connected
At least one booking type exists
Availability is defined
Once activated:

Forms go live
Booking links work
Automation starts running
📊 5. Business Dashboard (CRITICAL SECTION)
This dashboard is NOT for doing work.
It exists to answer one question only:

“What is happening in my business right now?”
Dashboard Must Clearly Show
1. Booking Overview
Today’s bookings
Upcoming bookings
Completed vs no-show count
2. Leads & Conversations
New inquiries
Ongoing conversations
Unanswered messages
3. Forms Status
Pending forms
Overdue forms
Completed forms
4. Inventory Alerts
Low-stock items
Critical inventory warnings
5. Key Alerts
Missed messages
Unconfirmed bookings
Overdue forms
Inventory risks
👉 Every alert must link to the exact place where action is needed.
💬 6. Inbox (Single Source of Communication)
All communication lives here:

Email
SMS
Automated messages
Manual replies
Rules:

One contact → one conversation
Full message history is preserved
When staff replies → automation pauses
👤 7. Customer Flow (No Login)
Customers interact only through:

Forms
Booking pages
Email/SMS
Flow A: Contact First
Customer submits contact form
System:Creates contact
Starts conversation
Sends welcome message
Staff replies
Staff shares booking link
Customer books
Flow B: Book First
Customer opens booking page
Selects date & time
Enters contact details
System automatically:

Creates contact
Creates booking
Sends confirmation
Sends forms
Schedules reminders
🧑‍💻 8. Staff Daily Flow
Staff log in to:

Open Inbox
Reply to customers
Manage bookings
Track form completion
Mark bookings as completed or no-show
Staff cannot change system logic.
⚙️ 9. Automation Rules (Strict & Predictable)
Automation must be event-based only.
Required rules:

New contact → welcome message
Booking created → confirmation
Before booking → reminder
Pending form → reminder
Inventory below threshold → alert
Staff reply → automation stops
🚫 No hidden logic
🚫 No magic conditions
📦 10. Inventory Alerts
When inventory drops below threshold:

Alert is sent (email or inbox)
Alert appears on dashboard
Event is logged
🔌 11. Integrations
At least two integrations must be implemented:

Email provider
SMS provider
Calendar integration
File storage
Webhooks
Integrations must:

Be abstracted
Fail gracefully
Never break core flows
📌 Refer to the Loom video for vision alignment and detailed understanding.
🧰 Tech Expectations
Frontend: React or Next.js with responsive design for different screen sizes
Backend: FastAPI (Python) or Node.js
Database: PostgreSQL must be scalable, reliable, and well-structured
